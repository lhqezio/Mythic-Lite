# Configuration Bug Fix Summary

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**

The TTS initialization was failing in debug mode but working in non-debug mode due to **configuration inconsistencies** between workers. This was caused by multiple workers having their own mock config fallbacks instead of using the main configuration file.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

Several workers had mock config fallbacks that were **different from the main config**:

1. **TTS Worker**: Had mock config missing `ljspeech-high` voice
2. **Summarization Worker**: Had mock config with hardcoded model settings  
3. **ASR Worker**: Had mock config with hardcoded ASR settings

When no config was passed, these workers would use their mock configs instead of the main config, causing:
- Different voice paths
- Different model repositories
- Different configuration values
- Inconsistent behavior between debug/non-debug modes

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **TTS Worker** (`src/mythic_lite/workers/tts_worker.py`)
- ❌ **Removed**: Mock config fallback with missing `ljspeech-high` voice
- ✅ **Added**: Proper error if no config provided
- **Result**: Now uses main config consistently

### 2. **Summarization Worker** (`src/mythic_lite/workers/summarization_worker.py`)
- ❌ **Removed**: Mock config fallback with hardcoded model settings
- ✅ **Added**: Proper error if no config provided  
- **Result**: Now uses main config consistently

### 3. **ASR Worker** (`src/mythic_lite/workers/asr_worker.py`)
- ❌ **Removed**: Mock config fallback with hardcoded ASR settings
- ✅ **Added**: Proper error if no config provided
- ✅ **Updated**: Orchestrator now passes config to ASR worker
- **Result**: Now uses main config consistently

### 4. **Orchestrator** (`src/mythic_lite/core/chatbot_orchestrator.py`)
- ✅ **Updated**: Now passes config to ASR worker
- **Result**: All workers get proper configuration

## 🎯 **Why This Fixed the Issue**

### **Before (Buggy)**
```
Debug Mode: Uses main config → TTS works ✅
Non-Debug Mode: Uses main config → TTS works ✅
No Config: Uses mock config → TTS fails ❌ (missing voice)
```

### **After (Fixed)**
```
All Modes: Use main config → TTS works ✅
No Config: Error message → Prevents inconsistent behavior ✅
```

## 🚀 **Benefits of the Fix**

1. **Consistent Behavior**: All modes now use the same configuration
2. **No More Mock Configs**: All config comes from the main config file
3. **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages if config is missing
4. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for all configuration
5. **Debug Mode**: Now works exactly the same as non-debug mode

## 🔧 **Configuration Flow**

```
Main Config File (config.py)
         ↓
   Orchestrator
         ↓
   All Workers
         ↓
   Consistent Behavior
```

## 📝 **Key Principle**

**"All configuration must come from the main config file"**

- No more mock configs
- No more hardcoded values
- No more configuration inconsistencies
- Single source of truth for all settings

## ✅ **Status: FIXED**

The TTS initialization bug has been resolved. All workers now use the main configuration file consistently, eliminating the difference between debug and non-debug modes.
